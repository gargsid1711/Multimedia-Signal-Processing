### MP1: Linear Predictive Coding
#### Speech sunthesis using LPC with an autocorrelation-based pitch detection algorithm
### MP2: Optical Flow
#### Video synthesis by moving around samples in a few base images. Movement vectors were computed from a low-resolution video using optical flow fields computed by the Lucas-Kanade algorithm
### MP3: Principal Component Analysis
#### Recognizes faces by projecting the images onto their principal components, then using a nearest-neighbor classifier
### MP4: Hidden Markov Model
#### Speech recognition using HMM
### MP5: Convolutional Neural Network
#### Using Faster-RCNN for face detection
